Read Me:
To compile: python <filename>.py
 WireframeCameraRevolution.py: In this python file camera is rotating around the model.
 SolidTeapotRotation.py : In this python file only model is rotating.

 Note: As I coded my assignment in Windows it may differs in the implementation.
 Also I have made some of the changes in the original code as it was giving error.
